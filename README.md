# React Native: Modal Screens with React Navigation

This is a repo to hold the code for my tutorial on using modal screens in React Native apps using the [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) framework, which you can find [here](http://devdude.me/blog/reactNativeModalScreens).

Feel free to fork or clone this repo, experiment with it, or use it as a starting point for other apps!
